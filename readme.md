ACsGuis

ACsGuis a Minecraft mod adding advanced guis with css support.
You create your guis with some java (or Sqript, soon), code, and you add beautiful styles with css code.

Many component styles are supported, as scrollable panels, labels, text areas, combo boxes, slots...

The CSS code has the same structure as standard css, and most of the basic and useful properties are supported, but everything will be on the doc.

Feel free to add this mod in library and use it for your guis, but modification is not allowed, or please make a pull request.
You can redistribute this mod if I'm in the credits.
